# Stardrop Docs

>*(Ink blooms amidst stardust into austere heraldry)*
>*A star core fallen here grows within oak tree rings, crystallizing into this codex shimmering with stardust. Gilded script etches the breath of ancient groves, while iron and redstone forge their covenant upon parchment. When your fingertips brush the warmth of its cover, stardust transforms into bookmarks to turn to the chapter written in your name*
>*(The pages part silently beneath celestial whispers)*
